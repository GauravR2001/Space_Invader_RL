•  Developed a Deep Reinforcement Learning model to play Space Invader (Atari Games)

•  Built model using Convolutional Neural Network and Deep Q-Network agent.

•  Utilized Epsilon Greedy Q-Policy and Linear Annealed Policy with Duelling Network Architecture

•  Trained DQN-agent to 1 million steps to achieve mean gamescore of 281.

•  Agent can be trained further by changing the n_steps
